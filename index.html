                        Everyone showed up prepared for the meeting and ready to get started on the project. <span>Some of the suggested ideas were the following:</span>
                        Pomodoro Timer, To-Do List, or a Calculator. <br>
                        Of these three ideas, we selected the <b>Pomodoro Timer</b>. <br>
                        The other two ideas were thrown out as the group consensus was that they were <i>too easy</i>. King Triton argued heavily that there is a lot of room
                        for creativity, specifically with the <em>To-Do List</em>, but was ultimately overruled by Jared and Aang.

                        One of the primary concerns introduced by the group was regarding the vague timeline requirements set forth by the project manager. King Triton was 
                        ultimately named the team leader and was tasked with asking the PM whether their produced timeline was reasonable. 
                        
                        Before coming into the meeting, Avatar Aang was relatively unfamiliar with the Pomodoro Technique. Jared presented the following graphic which explained
                        pretty clearly the breakdown of how the technique is utilized.
